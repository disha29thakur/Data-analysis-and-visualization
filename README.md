Introduction : 
The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous disasters in history. The Titanic dataset provides detailed information about the passengers on board, including their age, sex, ticket class, fare, and whether they survived. This project delves into the data to explore and visualize key aspects related to passenger demographics, survival rates, and fares.

Passenger Demographics : Understanding the demographics of the Titanic passengers is crucial to our analysis. We explore various aspects such as:
- Age Distribution: Examining the age range of passengers and identifying the most common age groups.
- Gender Distribution: Analyzing the ratio of male to female passengers.
- Class Distribution: Looking at the distribution of passengers across different ticket classes (First, Second, and Third).

Survival Rates: A core focus of our analysis is understanding the factors that influenced survival rates. We explore:
- Survival by Class: Comparing survival rates across different ticket classes.
- Survival by Gender: Analyzing the survival rates of male and female passengers.

Fare Analysis: The fare passengers paid for their tickets varied significantly. We analyze:
- Fare Distribution: Examining the range and distribution of fares.
- Fare by Class: Comparing average fares across different ticket classes.
- Fare and Survival: Investigating whether there is a correlation between the fare paid and survival rates.

Visualization : Visualizations play a key role in our analysis, helping to clearly communicate our findings. We use various types of charts and graphs to represent the data visually, making it easier to identify patterns and trends.

Conclusion : Our analysis of the Titanic dataset provides valuable insights into the demographics, survival rates, and fare structures of the passengers. By understanding these factors, we gain a deeper appreciation of the historical context and the tragic events that unfolded.
